|Question| Given Answer |Human Answer| Source|
|--------|--------------|------------|-------|
|What is topic modeling?| Modeling documents as arising from multiple topics| building a model of a document based on multiple topics| [Topic Modeling](TopicModels__BleiLafferty2009.pdf)|
|What is a topic?| A distribution over a fixed vocabulary of terms| a bunch of terms| [Topic Modeling](TopicModels__BleiLafferty2009.pdf)|
|How do we choose an appropriate topic number?|When the goal is qualitative, such as corpus exploration, one can use cross validation on predictive likelihood, essentially choosing the number of topics that provides the best language model. An alternative is to take a nonparametric Bayesian approach. Hierarchical Dirichlet processes can be used to develop a topic model in which the number of topics is automatically selected and may grow as new data is observed (Teh et al., 2007).|||

|Hidden Variable Model|"Hidden variable models are structured distributions in which
observed data interact with hidden random variables. With a hidden vari-
able model, the practitioner posits a hidden structure in the observed data,
and then learns that structure using posterior probabilistic inference"|||
